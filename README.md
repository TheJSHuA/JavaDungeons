<br/>

JavaDungeons is a Fabric mod that adds content from Minecraft Dungeons into Minecraft: Java Edition. Most textures are not made by me, and they were obtained from Minecraft: Dungeons. 

### Texture Rights

Most textures are ripped from Minecraft: Dungeons. All Dungeons texture rights go to the MC: Dungeons team (except for custom textures like seen in the Dungeons Transformer). Some have to be composited together manually by me due to how they handle texturing and materials in Dungeons. All models are either based off model files from the game, or estimated from what they look like in the game. 

### Naming of blocks

All blocks are named based on what I think they're closest to in Minecraft, unless they have a name in Dungeons. Blocks are categorized under where they're found most ingame, unless it's found in multiple locations, in which case it'll just be put under a general category.

### What will be added from Dungeons?

Mostly decoration blocks and weapons. Blocks & weapons with small color variations or shape variations from vanilla blocks will not be added.
