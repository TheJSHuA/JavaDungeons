JavaDungeons is a Fabric mod that adds content from Minecraft Dungeons into Minecraft: Java Edition. Most textures are not made by me, and they were obtained from Minecraft: Dungeons. 

### Texture Rights

Most textures are ripped from Minecraft: Dungeons. All Dungeons texture rights go to the MC: Dungeons team (except for custom textures like seen in the Dungeons Transformer). Some have to be composited together manually by me due to how they handle texturing and materials in Dungeons. All models are either based off model files from the game, or estimated from what they look like in the game. 

### Naming of blocks

All blocks are named based on what I think they're closest to in Minecraft, unless they have a name in Dungeons or are just obvious as to what they are. Blocks are categorized under what category they're put under in the game files (so files tagged creeper woods will be put in the creeper woods category, etc.), or where they're most found ingame.

### What will be added from Dungeons?

Mostly decoration blocks and weapons. Blocks & weapons with small color variations or shape variations from vanilla blocks will not be added. I have no plans to add in any entities, as getting them functionally similar to their Minecraft: Dungeons counterparts would be extremely difficult.
